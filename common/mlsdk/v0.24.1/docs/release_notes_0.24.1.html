      <li>Create Bond with peripheral device for an authenticated and encrypted communication between the devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>MLAppConnect</b>: Enables application to get the avatar settings, asset data (meshes, materials, textures), animation data, and material properties (e.g. model opacity, current hair color) from the Avatar Engine so that the Avatar model can be created and rendered from within the Application. Note: This API is meant to be used via other higher level rendering engines. Support for Unity and Unreal engines will be available in future releases.</li>
    <li><b>MLAvatar</b>: Enables application to get the avatar settings, asset data (meshed, materials, textures), material properties (e.g. model opacity, current hair color) from the Avatar Engine so that the Avatar model can be rendered from within the Application. Note: This meant to be used via other higher level rendering engines. Support for Unity and Unreal engines will be available in the future release.</li>
    <li><b>MLDCA</b>: Enables an ML1 app to subscribe to platform services for file modifications and create networking resources on behalf of a desktop application. This allows for applications on the desktop to be created that can communicate with certain ML1 platform services.</li>
    <li><b>MLFoundObject</b>: Enables application to query for objects in the real world. The following 5 object categories will be supported in this release: couch, chair, table, poster, and screen. Each found object will have an associated bounding box and score. This is an experimental feature.</li>
    <li><b>MLArucoTracker</b>: Enables applications to track square fiducial markers (also known as Augmented Reality Markers). It allows for rendering virtual content in relation to the location of Aruco markers that can be attached to flat surfaces.</li>

      <li>MLInputSetControllerCallbacks deprecated and replaced be MLInputSetControllerCallbacksEx.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Multi Media</b>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>MLMediaCCParserGetDisplayable deprecated and replaced by MLMediaCCParserGetDisplayableEx.</li>
      <li>MLCea608CaptionLine deprecated and replaced by MLCea608CaptionLineEx.</li>
      <li>MLCea608CaptionSegment deprecated and replaced by MLCea608CaptionSegmentEx.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>MLAudio</b>: APIs used for controlling frequencies for spatialization is deprecated, here is the list of the APIs: MLAudioSpatialSoundControlFrequencies, MLAudioSetSpatialSoundControlFrequencies, MLAudioGetSpatialSoundControlFrequencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Known Issues</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>MLAppConnectDataPipePropertiesInit and MLAppConnectVideoPipePropertiesInit incorrectly set the pipe direction to MLAppConnectPipeDirection_BiDirectional, it should be set to MLAppConnectPipeDirection_UniDirectionalOut.</li>
    <li>MLFoundObject API documentation mentions sofa as one of categories. But the actual label returned by the API is couch.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Object Recognition is using the RGB Camera for 5 seconds every 25 seconds which will prevent Ambient Light System (ALS) from running in those 5 seconds. Also, if the application attempt to open the camera during the 5 seconds it will fail.</li>
    <li>Use of the Applications Connectivity Platform API is currently provided free of charge, however Magic Leap reserves the right to charge for use of the ACP API in the future. Consumption of a disproportionate amount of available API network resources resulting in the potential to disrupt or degrade ACP usage by others is prohibited.</li>
    <li>MLAvatar API is meant to be used via other higher level rendering engines. Support for Unity and Unreal engines will be available in the future release.</li>
    <li>Object Recognition API is experimental.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Dev Tools</strong></h2>

  <h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>mabu: Fixed bug in cmake toolchain generation where user-provided flags were not separated from generated flags, causing build-time errors.</li>
    <li>mabu: Fixed bug not ignoring "package/validateManifest/off" option properly.</li>
    <li>mabu: Fixed bug where manifest validation warnings and errors were reported twice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>mldb</strong></h2>

  <h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>new 'ping-response' command makes the device respond to ping requests (ICMP echo). For security reasons, the device does not respond to pings by default. You can now make it respond during the current boot session with this command.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>When an application launch fails due to a missing library, "mldb log" output now contains the name of the missing library. More generally, all logging by libc in debuggable applications now shows up in 'mldb log'.</li>
    <li>Server process no longer crashes when unplugging a device.</li>
    <li>Some filesystem commands failed if the given path(s) didn't contain a leading forward slash. The slash is implicit and thus meant to be optional. For some commands, that wasn't the case.</li>
    <li>Fixed regression in SDK 0.23 mldb server that prevented multiple simultaneous device connections over TCP/IP. Make sure to do 'mldb kill-server' to start use the new (0.24) server.</li>
    <li>Fixed macOS mldb's inability to have more than four commands running in parallel.</li>
    <li>Fixed process leak in 'notify' command.</li>
  </ul>

    <h1><strong>Lumin Runtime SDK 0.24.1</strong></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Lumin OS 0.98.10</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lumin Runtime is a declarative application framework that enables you to author both Landscape and Immersive apps. Landscape apps can run and render simultaneously with other Landscape apps and are contained in a volume called a Prism. Immersive apps suspend all other apps and can utilize your entire space. Lumin Runtime relies on a client/server model to render multiple client applications within the real world. It facilitates application sharing out of the box, allowing application developers to collaborate with multiple users.</p>

    <p>The Lumin Runtime SDK adds support for creating Lumin Runtime applications to the Magic Leap Lumin SDK, including APIs, examples and build support.</p>

</div>
<div class='version'>

    <h1><strong>Lumin Runtime Editor 0.24.1</strong></h1>

    <p>The Lumin Runtime Editor tool provides you with comprehensive features for building scene graphs for your Lumin Runtime Landscape application. The editor  includes line, quad, text, model, and transform nodes with which you can arrange the graphical content of your app. All of the ready-made, animated, 3D UI elements from the Magic Leap UI Kit are also available as node types. These predefined UI nodes and properties enable you to rapidly design and develop apps that share the same design sense as other Lumin Runtime applications.</p>

    <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>MagicScript Components</li>
      <ul>
	      <li>Initial editor support for MagicScript components.</li>
	      <li>Visual Editing of scenes.</li>
	      <li>Project sources generated.</li>
	      <li>JSX for scenes dynamically updated as user edits.</li>
	      <li>Event handlers can be added.</li>
	      <li>Build support targets device, ZI, and mobile platforms.</li>
	      <li>Video resources supported for video component.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Prefabs</li>
      <ul>
	      <li>Supported for both Lumin RT (c++) and MagicScript.</li>
	      <li>Reusable sub-scenes that can be added to scenes via the editor.</li>
	      <li>Source generated allows user to spawn prefab instances dynamically.</li>
	      <li>Properties of sub-nodes can be exposed via the prefab root node.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

	<h2><strong>Known Issues</strong></h2>

   	 <ul>
		<li>VS2017 and VSCode fails to build a LRE project with a handler. The user must define their handlers to build successfully.</li>
		<li>MagicScript projects created using the editor will have a 'resources' dir that comes from the default MagicScript template, but the editor will put assets into the 'pipeline' dir when added to the asset library. Developers may still use the included 'resources' dir for their own purposes as this will be copied into the application.</li>
		<li>Quad component creation is disabled on MagicScript projects.</li>
		<li>Code generation for MagicScript projects may fail on windows for large or multiple scenes.</li>
		<li>Prefabs in MagicScript projects containing components with the external property selected will run into issues when adding handlers, or when adding the prefab to another scene. As a workaround, make properties public instead of making the entire component or prefab external.</li>
	 </ul>

  <h1><strong>Unreal Package 0.24.1</strong></h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Lumin SDK Version 0.24.1</li>
    <li>Unreal Version: Unreal Engine compatible with Lumin SDK 0.24.1</li>
    <li>Lumin OS 0.98.10</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Magic Leap's hardware and software is in a qualified developer release state right now. Some features or functionality of the Magic Leap hardware or software may not be available, may contain bugs or other defects, and/or may experience delays or failures. Please take a close look at this document since it contains valuable guidance on the current state of Magic Leap's hardware and software to help developers make the best possible use of the platform during our pre-release period. Want to know more? Head to the forums on our developer portal for more guidance.</p>

  <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>NOTE: 0.24.1 is a patch fix for Unity's spatial audio MSA plug-in and to mark C API Found Objects API as experimental. Lumin SDK 0.24.0 and 0.24.1 are otherwise identical for other platform areas.<li>
    <li>0.24.1 release is based on Unreal Engine 4.24.2.</li>
    <li>Events for audio muted / unmuted by system have been exposed via the engine's AudioMuteDelegate.</li>
    <li>Events for audio ducked / unducked by system have been exposed via the engine's UserMusicInterruptDelegate.</li>
    <li>Exposed functions to get and set mic mute state.</li>
    <li>Exposed CV camera API as a module of the MagicLeapCamera plugin. Access to the camera intrinsics, pose and texture frames (YUV_420 format only) is available via a BP function library (for more granular control) as well as a component (automatic tracker lifecycle management).</li>
    <li>Exposed graphics performance numbers provided by the platform via UMagicLeapHMDFunctionLibrary::GetGraphicsClientPerformanceInfo() function.</li>
    <li>Added ability for developers to set thread affinities by adding appropriate CVars to the Lumin / Lumin_Desktop device profiles or in ConsoleVariables.ini. The CVar lumin.DefaultThreadAffinity sets the thread affinity for Lumin platform with the arguments [MainGame|Rendering|RTHeartBeat|RHI|Pool|TaskGraph|TaskGraphBG|Audio] [int affinity] [optional int affinity2] [optional int affinity3]. e.g. lumin.DefaultThreadAffinity=MainGame 3 4 Rendering 2.</li>
    <li>Exposed events in LuminLifecycleApplicationComponent to notify app when input focus is lost or regained.</li>
    <li>Reduced app load out time by optimizing audio buffer flush during app termination.</li>
    <li>Exposed BP function to check if the Control is being held in a given hand.</li>
    <li>Exposed BP functions to get current API level of the platform and the minimum API level required by the engine.</li>
    <li>LAN privilege is requested automatically if app is launched with an IP address in the command-line.</li>
    <li>Oauth API has been exposed via the MagicLeapDispatch plugin. Triggering an OAuth request will launch the requested auth URL in the Helio browser.</li>
    <li>LuminARSessionConfig has been updated to expose a FMagicLeapPlanesQuery struct directly to maintain compatibility with the MagicLeapPlanesComponent.</li>
    <li>Added Visual Studio debugger support for Blueprint-only projects. Run GenerateProjectFiles.bat with the argument "-bponlyproject=&lt;full path to .uproject file&gt;". After that, you can open the generated UE4.sln file, switch the configuration to Lumin &amp; Developement / DebugGame etc and launch the app via the debugger.</li>
    <li>Exposed callbacks in MagicLeapARPin interface to notify the app when pins are added, updated or deleted. When using this on Lumin, developers can set how frequently the plugin should check for updates and what magnitude of changes in pin state should mark that pin as "updated". These settings are avaialble in Project Settings &gt; Magic Leap AR Pin in the Editor.</li>
    <li>Added a new member to the MagicLeapARPinState struct to indicate if the Pin can be shared with other devices or is local to the current device.</li>
    <li>Added a new query function to MagicLeapARPin interface where developers can specify which type of Pins they are interested in (local vs shared) and what volume should these be searched in. This provides a lot more control to filter out the Pins an app would be interested in, reducing the amount of data an app needs to sift through. The interface also allows setting a query filter at the global level which will affect the results reported by the pins added, updated, deleted notification callback. The MagicLeapARPinComponent has also been updated to use this new query filter to search for the most appropriate Pin to bind itself to.</li>
    <li>MagicLeapARPin interface has been updated to return "NotImplemented" instead of "Unavailable" when it is not implemented on a given platform vs the service being unavailable during that session.</li>
    <li>Exposed light estimation via the AugmentedReality interface in addition to the already available MagicLeapLightEstimation plugin. Choose "Ambient Light Estimate" in the AR session config to enable light estimation tracking.</li>
    <li>Exposed image tracking via the AugmentedReality interface in addition to the already available MagicLeapImageTrackerComponent.</li>
    <li>Updated planes integration in the AugmentedReality interface implementation for Lumin to set "SubsumedByPlane" property to indicate which outer plane a given inner plane belongs to.</li>
    <li>Updates planes integration in the AugmentedReality interface implementation for Lumin to use delta based queries for a more efficient measure of tracking planes.</li>
    <li>Magic Leap plugins are now built for iOS as well. While none of the features will be available to use on iOS, having the plugins enabled in your projects will no longer cause building and packaging to fail for either platform.</li>
    <li>Provide PinToBestFit(), PinToID() and PinToRestoredOrSyncedID() functions in MagicLeapARPinComponent to make it more explicit which PCF will be used for persistence.</li>
    <li>Expose ObjectUID and UserIndex properties of MagicLeapARPinComponent on spawn i.e. they'll appear in the AddMagicLeapARPinComponent() BP function. This is done to fix the issue where spawning this component at runtime always failed to restore data because BeginPlay() was called before app could set these params. Additionally, made the function UMagicLeapARPinComponent::AttemptPinDataRestoration() public so devs can call it after they set the required ObjectUID.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Deprecation Notices</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The MagicLeapScreens plugin deprecated in the last release has been removed from the engine. As a consequence, the ScreensProvider privilege, the IsScreensApp option in ProjectSettings, the "Screens" & "ScreensImmersive" component types have also been removed.</li>
    <li>We missed adding the 'MagicLeap' prefix to the MeshTrackerComponent in the previous release. This has been amended now and the MeshTrackerComponent has been renamed to MagicLeapMeshTrackerComponent. Note that this does not require changes in any of the existing Blueprints as appropriate redirectors have been put in place. C++ usage of this, however, would need to be updated. Please refer to Unreal Engine API Reference on https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/reference/public/v0.23.0/UnrealAPI/index.html for the complete list of data types.</li>
    <li>Deprecate PinSceneComponent() and PinActor() in MagicLeapARPinComponent and make them work only to pin the self component or the owner actor only. This is important because if we use these functions to pin some random component or actor, we cannot guarantee its restoration and thus persistence because the pinned reference will not mean anything in the next session.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Any project created with UE 4.23 has the setting r.DefaultFeature.AutoExposure.ExtendDefaultLuminanceRange=True in their DefaultEngine.ini. This setting breaks rendering on Vulkan Mobile path on 4.24 and should be removed.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where audio, animations etc would desync from the game when headpose was lost.</li>
    <li>Fixed hand tracking states not clearing out on consecutive VRPreview launches.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where image targets added for image tracking were not deleted when exiting VRPreview.</li>
    <li>Fixed error destroying input tracking when exiting VRPreview.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where next LaunchOn would fail if app is uninstalled outside of the Unreal environment.</li>
    <li>Fixed issues in destruction of ARPin (PCF) tracker.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where symbol stripping would fail for BP-only projects on Mac.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where performing any UBT or UAT operations on Mac would fail if MonoFramework is not already installed on the machine.</li>
    <li>Fixed cook warnings caused by uninitialized data members in the FMagicLeapPlanesQuery struct.</li>
    <li>Fixed errors in Put/GetSecureArray() functions that caused builds to fail when Blueprint nativization was enabled.</li>
    <li>Multiple entries for DOF quality were present in the Lumin_Desktop device profile which caused confusion about the default setting. Removed both entries and inherited the value from the parent device profile which disabled DOF by default.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where async versions of the MagicLeapLocation functions were not appearing in the Blueprints.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in MagicLeapDispatch module which added the requirement for including the MLSDK module as an additional dependency.</li>
    <li>r.TranslucentLightingVolume has been re-enabled in the Lumin_Desktop device profile as disabling it was found to be causing an additional 0.4ms on the GPU whereas keeping it enabled and not using translucent lighting volumes in your scene caused so additional cost.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio debugger used to archive the generated mpk at an odd location, outside of the project folder. Since the debugger picks up the mpk from the project's Binaries folder anyways, this archiving step has been removed when packaging an mpk from within VS.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where the new OpenHand gesture event was never fired and the deprecated OpenHandBack event was still getting reported instead. Note that after this fix OpenHandBack will not be fired and apps will need to replace the deprecated event with the OpenHand event.</li>
    <li>Fixed log spam of "unspecified failures" from ML function calls when attempting to join a server by passing an IP address in the mldb launch command line. The errors were harmless but no one likes to look at them.</li>
    <li>Fixed linker errors when using ML plugin data types in C++.</li>
    <li>Fixed a crash in the editor occurring when "Enable Zero Iteration" was checked in the Project Settings but ZI wasn't actually running.</li>
    <li>Fixed hand mesh render flickering.</li>
    <li>Fixed normal calculation for hand mesh.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug present in vanilla 4.24 where updating the Magic Leap SDK path in the Project Settings doesn't take effect until the editor is restarted.</li>
    <li>Fixed planes not working on consecutive VRPReview launches when using the AugmentedReality interface.</li>
    <li>Fixed MRMesh flickering when using the desktop renderer on UE 4.24.</li>
    <li>Fixed crashes when starting device stream while the app is actively using the camera.</li>
    <li>Fixed content persistence when bShouldPinActor in MagicLeapARPinComponent is true.</li>
  </ul>
