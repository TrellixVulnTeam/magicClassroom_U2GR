  <h1>Lumin SDK Release Notes</h1>
  <p>This document contains the Lumin SDK release notes including the notes for
    the core SDK, Unity&reg; integration, and Unreal Engine integration.</p>
<div class='version'>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <h1><strong>Lumin SDK 0.23.0</strong></h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Lumin OS 0.98</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Magic Leap's hardware and software is in a qualified developer release state right now. Some features or functionality of the Magic Leap hardware or software may not be available, may contain bugs or other defects, and/or may experience delays or failures. Please take a close look at this document since it contains valuable guidance on the current state of Magic Leap's hardware and software to help developers make the best possible use of the platform during our pre-release period. Want to know more? Head to the forums on our developer portal for more guidance.</p>


<h2><strong>C API</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Introduces MLConnections APIs  to send and receive invites to the people following the user in the Social App.</li>
    <li>Introduces MLContactsRequestSelection API to request a subset of contacts as manually selected by the user.</li>
    <li>Introduces MLMovements APIs for spatial movement of objects to feel like they have mass and inertia by tilting and swaying during movement, but still respecting the user's desired placement. Use this to be consistent with the movements in the Universe.</li>
    <li>Introduces MLPersistentCoordinateFramesGetFrameState to get additional state data that includes the confidence in the Persistent Coordinate Frame within the valid radius and the rotation and translation error.</li>
    <li>Introduces new callback in the MLLifecycle to let the application know when it loses or regains focus. When focus is lost, the application will not receive input events.</li>
    <li>Introduces MLLocationGetLastFineLocation to fetch the last known fine location. The API also provides the accuracy of the location.</li>
    <li>MLEyeTrackingStaticData now provides the left and right eye gaze vector.</li>
    <li>MLHandTrackingState now provides whether the hand is holding a Control or not. This feature will have more improvements in future releases, please refer to known issues section for the current limitations.</li>
    <li>Introduces MLHandTrackingKeyPoint enum to provide the ordering of the keypoints.</li>
    <li>MLGraphicsFrameInfo structure is updated to provide a handle to a synchronization object that must be cast to VkSemaphore and used during queue submission of a Vulkan app. GL apps can ignore this member.</li>
    <li>Introduces new MLAudio APIs to get/set head relative sound and the memory footprint for the loaded audio source.</li>
    <li>Three additional events added to MLMediaDRMEvenType: MLMediaDRMEvenType_SessionReclaimed, MLMediaDRMEvenType_ExpirationUpdate, MLMediaDRMEvenType_KeysChange.</li>
    <li>Renamed the MLAudio "Input Stream" and "Output Stream" APIs to "Buffered Input" and "Buffered Output" APIs. The older Stream APIs are deprecated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Deprecation Notices</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The MLScreens API and its privilege ScreensProvider are deprecated.</li>
    <li>The following MLAudio APIs are deprecated:</li>
    <ul>
       <li>MLAudioCreateSoundWithOutputStream</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetOutputStreamDefaults</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetOutputStreamLatency</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetOutputStreamFramesPlayed</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetOutputStreamBuffer</li>
       <li>MLAudioReleaseOutputStreamBuffer</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetInputStreamDefaults</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetInputStreamLatency</li>
       <li>MLAudioGetInputStreamBuffer</li>
       <li>MLAudioReleaseInputStreamBuffer</li>
    </ul>
    <li>MLGraphicsVirtualCameraInfoArray is deprecated. This is included in the updated version of MLGraphicsFrameInfo.</li>
    <li>MLHandTrackingHandState is deprecated and replaced by MLHandTrackingHandStateEx.</li>
    <li>MLHandTrackingData is deprecated and replaced by MLHandTrackingEx.</li>
    <li>MLHandTrackingGetData is deprecated and replaced by MLHandTrackingGetDataEx.</li>
    <li>All Controller 6DOF data exposed by way of the MLInput APIs are deprecated. Use the MLController APIs instead.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Known Issues</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>MLHandTracking can now detect if a hand is holding the Control or not. But the current version can have some false positives. One way to address this issue would be to use the MLControl APIs to check the position of the Control to eliminate the false positives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>MLControllerButton_HomeTap cannot be polled, this button is only available via the callbacks.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><strong>Dev Tools</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Added experimental support for clang 8.0 and its associated libc++ when targeting Lumin. (See https://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/tools/clang/docs/index.html.)
      <br><br>
      NOTE: clang 3.8 is still the default; use mabu -t lumin_clang-8 to select this version.</li>
 </ul>

<h3><strong>Changes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The mabu: using build target '...' message is always printed, even when an explicit -t ...is passed, in order to clarify what the expanded build specification is. (Use -q to suppress this.).</li>
    <li>Improved mabu error reporting when a user override of CC=... or CXX=...results in an error.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed mabu bug where unknown *.config or *.option files next to the project would fail the load. If these are obviously not mabu files (XML, binary, etc.) they are silently ignored. Otherwise, such files only generate warnings rather than failing to build.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in mabu cmake toolchain generation in not passing --sysroot=... in CMAKE_C[XX]_FLAGS.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where in some environments, mabu would fail to sign .mpks when there are multiple Python installations on the path.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug trying to detect toolchains with a plain --version request (this was causing problems in Win32 systems with no Visual Studio, and was also doing unnecessary work).</li>
    <li>Fixed detection of Apple clang 11.0 and newer.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2><strong>mldb</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>New command '<b>get-standby</b>' shows if device is in standby mode (Lightpack is awake, but Lightwear is asleep).</li>
    <li>Lumin OS API level is now exposed by way of the property <b>ro.ml.shipping.api.level</b></li>
 </ul>

 <h3><strong>Changes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>mldb bugreport</b> now requires that you supply the device PIN (with -p) if the device is locked.</li>
    <li><b>mldb df</b> now shows the amount of the userdata partition reserved for the OS.</li>
    <li><b>mldb perf</b> no longer shows thermal metrics and shows a reduced set of power metrics.</li>
    <li><b>mldb reverse</b> is no longer limited to debuggable apps and no longer limited to a range of ports.</li>
    <li>symbolic links can no longer be pushed to the device.</li>
 </ul>

  <h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>improvement to <b>usbreg</b> command.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<div class='version'>

    <h1><strong>Lumin Runtime SDK 0.23.0</strong></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Lumin OS 0.98</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lumin Runtime is a declarative application framework that enables you to author both Landscape and Immersive apps. Landscape apps can run and render simultaneously with other Landscape apps and are contained in a volume called a Prism. Immersive apps suspend all other apps and can utilize your entire space. Lumin Runtime relies on a client/server model to render multiple client applications within the real world. It facilitates application sharing out of the box, allowing application developers to collaborate with multiple users.</p>

    <p>The Lumin Runtime SDK adds support for creating Lumin Runtime applications to the Magic Leap Lumin SDK, including APIs, examples and build support.</p>

    <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

  <p>Magic Leap's hardware and software is in a qualified developer release state right now. Some features or functionality of the Magic Leap hardware or software may not be available, may contain bugs or other defects, and/or may experience delays or failures. Please take a close look at this document since it contains valuable guidance on the current state of Magic Leap's hardware and software to help developers make the best possible use of the platform during our pre-release period. Want to know more? Head to the forums on our developer portal for more guidance.</p>

  <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>0.23.0 release is based on Unreal Engine 4.23.0.</li>
    <li>Added MagicLeapConnections plugin to send invitations to the user's Magic Leap connections to initiate a multi-user experience. Apps need to add the SocialConnectionsInvitesAccess privilege to manifest to use this API.</li>
    <li>Added MagicLeapMovementComponent which makes moving objects feel as if they have mass and inertia by tilting and swaying during movement. The component being moved will respect all blocking collisions. Developers can also choose to have soft collisions (allowing a degree of penetration before hitting an impenetrable core) with overlapping objects.</li>
    <li>Exposed MagicLeapNetworking plugin which provides functions to check internet connectivity status and wifi data (RSSI, link speed, frequency). Apps need to add the Internet privilege to manifest to use this API.</li>
    <li>Exposed ARPin translation and rotational errors via FMagicLeapARPinState.</li>
    <li>Added a boolean parameter (true by default) to SetStabilizationDepthActor() and SetFocusActor() which will set the both StabilizationDepthActor and FocusActor to the same input Actor.</li>
    <li>Updated bRemoveDebugInfo option in the Magic Leap Project Settings to only affect symbol stripping. The sym file will be generated regardless of this option. Whether the symbols will be stripped from the executable is managed by this.</li>
    <li>Enabled delayed library loading for the MLSDK libs on all platforms, including Lumin. Calling functions that were not located in the available libraries will return MLResult_NotImplemented instead of just crashing, making Unreal Engine usage more flexible across different MLSDK and LuminOS versions.</li>
    <li>Added Blueprint function to query if a given ML controller is connected.</li>
    <li>Added GPU crash marker support for Vulkan on Lumin. Set r.GPUCrashDebugging and r.gpucrash.collectionenable to 1 in the Lumin device profile or in ConsoleVariables.ini to enable GPU crash collection.</li>
    <li>Exposed a timestamp with the FMLInputTabletDeviceState data.</li>
    <li>Exposed state change callbacks for Music Service to Blueprints.</li>
    <li>Unreal examples have been updated to calibrate the Pawn on map load so as to make the app launch position the origin instead of keeping the origin stuck to the device boot location. Check out the XRPawn blueprint for the calibration logic. The setup of MotionControllers, MRMesh, and so on have also been updated to respect the pawn calibration.</li>
    <li>Reduced frequency of the expensive audio jack update check to free up the audio thread.</li>
    <li>Updated time consuming UMagicLeapImageTrackerFunctionLibrary::EnableImageTracking() &amp; UMagicLeapImageTrackerFunctionLibrary::SetMaxSimultaneousTargets() functions to be asynchronous.</li>
    <li>MagicLeapSecureStorage now supports int64, Blueprint Structs, TArrays and USaveGame objects. Functions for storing and retrieving explicit structs (FVector, FTransform etc) have been deprecated and should be replaced with Get/PutSecureArray.</li>
    <li>MagicleapLocations API functions have a new parameter to choose between getting a fine location and a coarse location. The accuracy of the fine location radius is also provided. The locations integration can also be used by way of the "Mobile Location Services Blueprint Library" plugin interface.</li>
    <li>Added support for localized app names. Add the language code and corresponding name for the app in the Advanced MPK Packaging section in the Magic Leap Project Settings in the Editor.</li>
    <li>Added getters functions for hand keypoints to motion source names and vice-versa.</li>
    <li>ImageTrackerComponent has been moved into it's own module named MagicLeapImageTracker. There is no change required for Blueprints as the appropriate redirectors have been put in place but C++ developers will now need to add this new module as a dependency in their game / plugin module's Build.cs file and include MagicLeapImageTrackerComponent.h header.</li>
    <li>Added selection functionality to the MagicLeapContacts plugin.  Developers can now instigate a system ui popup that displays all of their contacts.  The user can then select which contacts they wish to retrieve data as well as filter the fields to be retrieved.</li>
    <li>Added a template in the Editor which sets up an XRPawn and a "Hello Cube!" map to help jump start development for Magic Leap.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Deprecation Notices</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To avoid naming conflicts with any other data types defined in the engine or the accompanying plugins, all public data types (enums, structs &amp; classes) in the Magic Leap plugins have been prefixed with 'MagicLeap'. For example, URaycastComponent is now UMagicLeapRaycastComponent, FRaycastHitResult is now FMagicLeapRaycastHitResult and so on. Note that this does not require any changes in any of the existing blueprints as appropriate redirectors have been put in place. C++ usage of these, however, would need to be updated. Please refer to the Unreal Engine API Reference on https://developer.magicleap.com/learn/reference/public/v0.23.0/UnrealAPI/index.html for the complete list of data types.</li>
    <li>OpenHandBack gesture has been deprecated and its usage should be replaced with OpenHand.</li>
    <li>PwFoundObjRead privilege has been deprecated and its usage should be replaced with PcfRead.</li>
    <li>Deprecated SetBasePosition/Orientation/Rotation functions. The XRPawn setup should be used instead to manipulate.</li>
    <li>The "additional contents" packaging option has been removed from the Magic Leap Project Settings. The regular options under the Engine's Packaging settings should be used.</li>
    <li>The "additional content binary" packaging option has been removed from the Magic Leap Project Settings. Binaries to be packaged should be added as Runtime Dependencies or Unreal Plugin Language should be used to copy the files over to the bin folder of the staging directory.</li>
    <li>MagicLeapScreensComponent which was deprecated in MLSDK 0.21.0 has now been deleted.</li>
    <li>MagicLeapScreens API integration has been marked deprecated and will be removed in the next release.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Known Issues / Disclaimers</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>With every engine upgrade, many new features and tools are added by Epic Games. It is possible that the path for certain files in the engine gets too long for Windows. It is advised to keep the root folder path for the engine installation to the minimum possible to avoid "path too long" errors.</li>
    <li>ML device does not appear in Session Frontend on Mac.</li>
    <li>Symbol stripping on the final Lumin executable fails on Mac for Blueprint-only projects when using the Magic Leap UE4 Editor from Epic Games Store (issue not seen in source builds). This error does not fail the actual packaging process itself and can be ignored during development. If you still want the symbols to be stripped, delete the Intermediate/Lumin/Mabu/Binaries folder in your project before triggering the package build. A proper fix is planned in a future MLSDK release.</li>
    <li>All UBT, UAT operations and anything else that requires Mono fails on Mac when using the Magic Leap UE4 Editor from Epic Games Store (issue not seen in source builds) <b>if MonoFramework is not already installed</b> on the host machine. You can install MonoFramework on your Mac either via MonoDevelop or via Visual Studio for Mac. A proper fix will be provided in the next MLSDK release.</li>
    <li>Video capture sample fails if Bumper is pressed too frequently.</li>
