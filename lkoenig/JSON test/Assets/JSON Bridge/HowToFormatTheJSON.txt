How to format the "Big JSON":

The first layer of the JSON should contain the Logic scripts and object. 
I've been parenting this to the [SCENE_MANAGEMENT] folder.
Generally use the "empty" type for this and put 0 for both the position and scale.

Add the names of the scripts that should be attached to the logic object to the scriptsToAdd array.
These should bee added as just the name. So if it's pulse.cs then just write pulse in the array. 

Following that add all independedent objects to the numOfChildren Array. 
These objects should have the correct base folders as their parents.
Assign the proper locations, materials, and scripts that should be attached.
In the children arrays of the indipendent objects assign only child objects. 

I'm going to make a graphic.
