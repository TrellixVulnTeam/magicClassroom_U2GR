/*This will store the info needed about the planets
 * ie orbits/rotations/materials used(hopefully)/size/distance/ect
 * In theory orbits and rotations ahould be properly proportioned and then it will be scaled in the TimeManager
 * It will be based on the fact that FixedUpdate has a fixed time
 * And that Earth will rotate 
 * 
 * This also maybe shouldn't be a MonoBehaviour but I'll deal with that later
